## How does the automatic pet food dispenser work?

The automatic pet food dispenser consists of a pet food container, a spiral
dispenser and a pet food plate. The spiral dispenser is connected to the servo
motor. Once the servo motor is triggered and start rotating, the spiral
dispenser will push the pet food out.

## How do we use Firebase API to establish robust connection?

We try to construct a request/response connection model between the browser
(which acts like a client) and the environmental monitoring system(which acts
like a server). To illustrate the idea, we take light control for example and
some trivial checks are skipped. Note that true means 'on'/'turn on' and false
means 'off'/'turn off' for `relay/status.lightIsOn` and
`relay/command.switchLight`, respectively.

- Whenever the user click the light bulb button, the client will check if
  `relay/command.switchLight` is equal to `relay/status.lightIsOn`. If so, then
  the client will change `relay/command.switchLight` into the target state. If
  `relay/command.switchLight` is not equal to `relay/status.lightIsOn`, it means
  the server has not completed the last command sent by the clients so we simply
  skip it.
- The server listens on `relay/command.switchLight`. Whenever its value is
  changed, the server will change the relay controlling the light bulb into the
  target state.
- After the server has successfully change the state, the server will change the
  `relay/status.lightIsOn` into the current state of the relay controlling the
  light bulb. Note that this is why we say if `relay/command.switchLight` is not
  equal to `relay/status.lightIsOn`, it means the server has not completed the
  last command sent by the clients.
- The client listens on `relay/status.lightIsOn`. Whenever its value is changed,
  the client will change the unlighted light bulb image into lighted light bulb
  image or in the opposite way.
